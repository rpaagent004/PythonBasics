Python basics for beginners
Interpreter Lanuage
An interpreted language is a type of programming language for which most of its implementations execute instructions
directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes
 the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another
 language (often machine code).

Difference between interpreted and compiled languages?
The difference between an interpreted and a compiled language lies in the result of the process of interpreting or
compiling. An interpreter produces a result from a program, while a compiler produces a program written in assembly
language. ... Creating a compiled program requires several steps

Why Python is the best?
Because of the run-time typing, Python's run time must work harder than Java's. ... For these reasons, Python is much
better suited as a "glue" language, while Java is better characterized as a low-level implementation language. In fact,
the two together make an excellent combination


Compiled Versus Interpreted Languages
Every program is a set of instructions, whether it’s to add two numbers or send a request over the internet. Compilers and interpreters take human-readable code and convert it to computer-readable machine code. In a compiled language, the target machine directly translates the program. In an interpreted language, the source code is not directly translated by the target machine. Instead, a different program, aka the interpreter, reads and executes the code.

Okay… but what does that actually mean?
So let’s say you have an hummus recipe that you want to make, but it’s in Ancient Greek. There are two ways you, as a
non-Ancient-Greek speaker, could follow its directions.

The first is if someone had translated it into English for you already. You (and anyone else who could speak English)
could get the English version and make hummus. This is the compiled version.

The second is if you had a friend who knows Ancient Greek. Your friend can sit next to you and translate the Ancient
Greek into English, line by line, as you go. In this case, your friend is the interpreter. This is the interpreted version.
